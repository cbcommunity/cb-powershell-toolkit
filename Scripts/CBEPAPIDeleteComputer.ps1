        .SYNOPSIS
        This script takes in a computer name and deletes it from CBEP
        .DESCRIPTION
        This script will delete a computer from CBEP as long as the computer is turned off. It looks for a computer name just as it appears in the console.
        For example, if your computers are all on a domain called DOMAINABC, the computer name would look like this: DOMAINABC\Computer1
        The input can accept wildcards if you don't want to add the full name OR if you want to delete multiple computers with a common set of characters.
        .PARAMETER computerName
        The name of the computer you wish to delete. Wildcards are accepted.
        .EXAMPLE
        C: <PS> .\CBEPAPIDeleteComputer.ps1 -computername *computer00*
        This will delete any computer matching the characters with the wildcards before and after the string
