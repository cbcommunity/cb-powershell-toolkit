        .SYNOPSIS
        This script is designed to be used with a VDI environment to automate template updates.
        .DESCRIPTION
        This script uses the CB Protection API to automate the deletion and creation of templates so that child machines start up with the most recent catalog and have the most recent file list in CBEP.
        In order to accomplish this, the target "golden image" needs to be fully synchronized and needs to be powered off. Once that is done, the script will delete the old template and create
        a new one based on the powered off computer.
        .PARAMETER computerName
        string - This is the name of your "golden image" machine
        .PARAMETER timeout
        system.int32 - This is the time in minutes that the script should wait for the machine to be ready to convert to a template. The defaut value is 1 minute.
        .EXAMPLE
        .\CBEPAPITemplateUpdate.ps1 -computerName GOLDEN_IMAGE -timeout 5
